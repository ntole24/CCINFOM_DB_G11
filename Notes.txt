Important things to note about this DB app:
- You have to run the SQL locally first then run the java codes. I'm not sure if that's right
or if we're supposed ot use the sql accounts in the DLSU laptops (check 40:00 in sir oli's masterclass)
- You also need to change the user and password in every java file (surely there's a way around this)

Other timestamps:
